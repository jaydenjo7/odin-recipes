            <li>4 puff pastry shells</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>3/4 sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced shallot</li>
            <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>1/4 dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sherry</li>
            <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 shredded cheese</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped tarragon</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
 
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove all wrapping from the pastry shells and set on an ungreased baking sheet.<br> Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and puffed, about 20 minutes (follow directions on package).</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bay scallops, and saute quickly on both sides until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.<br> Do not overcook. Remove scallops from skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium, and melt remaining tablespoon butter. Add mushrooms and shallots, and saut√® until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk half-and-half and flour into the skillet, whisking until thickened; add white wine, sherry, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard, and whisk into the cream sauce.</li>
            <li>Stir in Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon tarragon, and pepper. Return scallops to the cheese sauce, stir, and reheat briefly.</li>
            <li>Remove top of the puff pastry shell, and fill with cheesy scallops, overflowing slightly to serve. Garnish with additional fresh tarragon if you like.</li>

        </ol>
